# safeRace
Safe race is on a mission to educate youth through technology that is visually empowering.  SafeRace is a place to share experiences of racism and segregation in Chicago through social media. SafeRace helps youth find opportunities to help change their community and city. Saferace hopes to abolish ignorance among youth and help inform the youth of Chicago of the segregation that happens in their own city.
